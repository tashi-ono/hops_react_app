### Project Description

HOPickin is a web application that allows you to search through a list of hops and get information on its origin and alpha acid content.
This app is meant to be a comprehensive database on hop varieties across all hop farm companies.

Currently, this application requires a larger API database or several databases to fill in missing hops and other information, ie. country of origin, description, and alpha acid content.

### Tech Framework

Built using:

- React.js
- Bootstrap

### API Reference

[BreweryDB](https://sandbox-api.brewerydb.com/v2/)

### How to Use

Scroll through and search for your hops or use the search bar. The search bar can take the full hop name or a couple letters to filter through the list and display matching names.
