## Project Description

My project will be a react app for hop varieties, using a mobile-first approach. The app will pull in an API and the user will get a full list of hops to scroll through. The user will also be able to search through the hops by name.

## API

Here is a code snippet from my API at [BreweryDB](https://www.brewerydb.com/developers):

```

{
"id": 4,
"name": "Amarillo",
"description": "Amarillo is a privately grown and registered hop variety; it was introduced recently but has been extremely popular with brewers seeking a Cascade-type hop with a distinctive American character. It is considered by many to be ideal for dry hopping, but also gives a clean bitterness due to low cohumulone content. The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness. Amarillo is a registered trademark of Virgil Gamache Farms, Inc., where the hop was originally developed.",
"countryOfOrigin": "US",
"alphaAcidMin": 8,
}
```

<!-- ## Components

##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. -->

<!-- | Component |                          Description                          |
| --------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
| App       | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router |
| Header    |         This will render the header including the nav         |
| Footer    |                  This will render the footer                  | -->

<!-- Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a <strong>panda prize</strong>. -->
