      <p>
        We are a one-stop library for all your hop-knowledge needs. <br />
        Other libraries affiliated to hop farms only provide information for the
        varieties they grow. HOPickin has all the information you need for your
        next brew.
      </p>
      <p>So get brewing, and get HOPickin!</p>
